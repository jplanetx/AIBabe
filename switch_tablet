Prompt for Switching to Tablet Environment
Next Steps for Your Tablet Setup
Cloud-Based Docker Environment:

Choose a cloud provider to host your Docker containers. Recommended options:
Railway.app: Simple setup for Docker containers and managed PostgreSQL databases.
Render.com: Affordable and developer-friendly platform for containerized applications.
AWS Fargate: Serverless container hosting for scalable environments.
Set up your PostgreSQL shadow database and update .env with the cloud connection string.
Tablet Workflow:

Access your codebase via VS Codespaces or a similar cloud IDE.
Ensure your tablet has access to the cloud-hosted Docker environment.
Use Prisma CLI (npx prisma migrate dev) to apply migrations and verify the database connection.
Continue Development:

Focus on implementing CRUD utilities for semantic memory management.
Integrate semantic memory into the chat API.
Test and refine the system using High-Level Acceptance Tests (HLTs).
