# AI Girlfriend Chat Application - Project Brief

## Project Overview
An AI-powered girlfriend chat application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Pinecone, and OpenAI. The application provides personalized AI companions with persistent memory and semantic search capabilities.

## Current State
- **Status**: Development phase with basic infrastructure in place
- **Problem**: Chat functionality is currently "dumb" with placeholder responses
- **Goal**: Implement intelligent chat with vector database, embeddings, and semantic reasoning

## Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ (App Router), TypeScript, React
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI (LLM + Embeddings), Pinecone (Vector Database)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Intelligent Chat System**
   - Real-time AI responses using OpenAI
   - Persona-based character consistency
   - Context-aware conversations

2. **Semantic Memory System**
   - Vector embeddings for conversation history
   - Semantic search through past interactions
   - Long-term memory persistence

3. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Personalized AI girlfriends
   - Conversation continuity
   - Emotional intelligence and empathy

## Current Architecture
- Basic Next.js application structure
- Placeholder chat API endpoints
- Mock vector database implementation
- Supabase integration (partially implemented)
- Authentication system (implemented)

## Immediate Priorities
1. Replace placeholder chat system with real AI integration
2. Implement vector database for semantic memory
3. Create intelligent prompt engineering system
4. Add conversation context management
5. Integrate personality-driven responses
