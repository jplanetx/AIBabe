# Key Research Questions: AI-Babe Chat System Overhaul

This document outlines the key questions that will guide the research for the "AI-Babe Chat System Overhaul" project. These questions are derived from the project's overall goal, the user's objective to improve chat quality and reduce repetition, and the specific tasks outlined in the User Blueprint.

## I. Overall Project & User Experience

1.  What are the primary causes of the chatbot "repeating itself after just a few back and forths," and how can the proposed tasks (memory, vector DB, prompt engineering) directly address this?
2.  How can the overhaul ensure a more "intelligent" and "consistent" chat experience from the user's perspective?
3.  What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for a successful chat system overhaul in this context (e.g., reduced repetition, increased session length, positive user feedback on memory/consistency)?
4.  Considering the Next.js/Vercel stack, what are the overarching architectural best practices for building a scalable and maintainable chat system with advanced memory and RAG capabilities?

## II. Task-Specific Questions

### A. TASK 1 — Backend API Resilience

1.  What are the most effective and idiomatic ways to implement `try/catch` blocks for `fetch/axios` requests in Next.js API routes (specifically for chat interactions)?
2.  What are best practices for designing user-friendly fallback UIs and error messages in a chat interface when backend APIs fail or return errors?
3.  How can exponential backoff be implemented robustly for API retries (503/504 errors) in a serverless environment like Vercel, considering potential cold starts and execution limits?
4.  What constitutes a comprehensive and standardized error response schema (e.g., `{ error_code, message }`) for chat backend APIs that is useful for both frontend handling and backend logging/debugging?
5.  Are there specific libraries or patterns recommended for managing API resilience in Next.js/Vercel deployments?

### B. TASK 2 — Implement Persistent Memory Layer

1.  What are the specific pros and cons of using PostgreSQL versus MongoDB for a persistent memory layer (user preferences, conversation summaries) in a Next.js/Vercel application, considering schema flexibility, query capabilities, scalability, and ease of integration?
2.  What is an optimal and extensible database schema for storing `user_id`, `preferences`, `conversation_summary`, and `timestamp` to support long-term memory and recall?
3.  What are the most efficient strategies for loading user-specific memory at the start of a chat session and updating it at the end (or incrementally) without negatively impacting perceived performance?
4.  Which LLM-based summarization techniques and models are most effective and cost-efficient for summarizing large chat conversations for storage, and how can this be integrated into the Next.js backend?
5.  How can potential PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in conversation summaries be handled or minimized?

### C. TASK 3 — Add Semantic Memory (Vector DB)

1.  What are the key differentiators, advantages, and disadvantages of leading vector database solutions (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Supabase pgvector, ChromaDB, Qdrant) when integrated with a Next.js/Vercel application, focusing on ease of use, cost, scalability, and query latency?
2.  Which embedding models (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`, Sentence Transformers from HuggingFace) offer the best balance of performance, cost, and semantic relevance for chat conversation data?
3.  What are best practices for chunking long conversation turns or entire conversations for effective embedding and retrieval? What metadata or tags are most useful to store alongside conversation chunks?
4.  How can cosine similarity (or other similarity metrics) be most effectively used to query the vector DB during prompt construction to retrieve relevant past interactions or preferences?
5.  What are the practical challenges and solutions for integrating a vector DB into a RAG pipeline to enhance persona consistency and contextual responses?
6.  How does the choice of vector DB impact data management, backup, and security considerations?

### D. TASK 4 — Fix Persona Drift via Prompt Engineering

1.  What are established best practices for designing layered system prompts (e.g., a base persona prompt + dynamically injected memory/RAG context) to maintain a consistent AI persona (flirty, smart, caring)?
2.  How can a RAG pipeline be effectively designed to inject persona-specific facts, preferences, and past interaction snippets into the prompt at each turn?
3.  What techniques exist to "pin" or reinforce the core persona context in every interaction without consuming an excessive number of tokens in the prompt?
4.  Is there publicly available information or research on the "PersonaGym" method, and what are its core principles if so? If not, what are analogous or well-regarded methodologies for persona consistency?
5.  How can the system be designed to dynamically adjust the amount or type of contextual information (from persistent or semantic memory) injected into the prompt based on the current conversation state or user query?
6.  What are common pitfalls in prompt engineering for persona consistency, and how can they be avoided?

### E. TASK 5 — Chat Frontend Error Handling & UX

1.  What are robust JavaScript/TypeScript patterns for adding error guards to asynchronous chat message handlers in a React/Next.js frontend?
2.  How can the frontend display clear, non-intrusive error messages and provide intuitive retry options to the user when chat messages fail to send or responses are not received?
3.  What are the current best practices and libraries for implementing response streaming from Next.js API routes to a React frontend to improve the perceived responsiveness of the chat UI?
4.  What are the key mobile responsiveness and accessibility (WCAG) compliance considerations specifically for chat interfaces, including input areas, message display, and interactive elements like retry buttons?
5.  How can frontend state management (e.g., Zustand, Redux, React Context) be effectively used to manage chat state, including pending messages, error states, and streamed responses?

## III. Cross-Cutting & Orchestration Questions

1.  What are the potential performance bottlenecks when integrating these different layers (API resilience, persistent memory, vector DB, advanced prompting, frontend UX) in a Next.js/Vercel environment, and how can they be proactively addressed?
2.  How can the requirement for modules to be <500 LOC be practically achieved while implementing these complex features, and what architectural patterns support this (e.g., microservices-like API routes, clear separation of concerns)?
3.  What are effective integration testing strategies for a system with these interconnected components, especially when deployed on Vercel? How can dependencies between tasks (as per orchestration notes) be managed in the testing plan?
4.  Given the orchestration notes (stabilize backend/frontend first, then parallel memory/vector DB, then prompting), what are the critical interfaces and data contracts that need to be defined early to allow for parallel development?
5.  What are the security implications of storing user conversation data (even summarized) and preferences, and what are best practices for securing this data both in transit and at rest, particularly with PostgreSQL/MongoDB and vector DBs?
