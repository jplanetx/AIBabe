# Key Research Questions

This document outlines the critical questions to be addressed during the research phase for the "Implement Enhanced Chat Functionality with User Authentication and Semantic Search" project. These questions are derived from the research objectives and the defined scope.

## 1. Tech Stack Integration (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI)
    - What are the established best practices for integrating Supabase (auth & DB) with a Next.js (TypeScript) application?
    - What are the best practices for integrating Pinecone with a Next.js backend for semantic search?
    - How should OpenAI's embedding service be integrated for generating embeddings from chat messages to be stored in Pinecone?
    - What are common challenges and pitfalls when combining these specific technologies, and what are their mitigation strategies?
    - Are there specific Next.js architectural patterns (e.g., API routes, server components, client components) that are best suited for interacting with Supabase and Pinecone?
    - What are the version compatibility considerations between these services/libraries?

## 2. User Authentication (Supabase in Next.js)
    - What are the most secure and user-friendly patterns for implementing user authentication (signup, login, logout, password reset, session management) with Supabase in a Next.js application?
    - How should Supabase Auth integrate with Next.js middleware or route handlers for protecting routes?
    - What are best practices for managing user sessions and tokens (e.g., refresh tokens, secure storage)?
    - How can social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub) be implemented with Supabase Auth in Next.js?
    - What are the specific security considerations (e.g., XSS, CSRF, data validation) for Supabase authentication in this stack?

## 3. Semantic Search Implementation (Pinecone & OpenAI)
    - What is the optimal data model/schema for storing chat message embeddings and metadata in Pinecone for efficient semantic search?
    - What are the best practices for data ingestion into Pinecone, including batching, error handling, and updating existing vectors?
    - Which OpenAI embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002` or newer/alternative models) offers the best balance of performance, cost, and quality for chat message semantics? What are the dimensionalities and how do they impact Pinecone?
    - How should queries be constructed and executed against Pinecone from the Next.js backend to retrieve relevant chat history based on semantic similarity?
    - What strategies can be used to filter search results by user, conversation, or other metadata in Pinecone?
    - How can the performance of semantic search (latency, relevance) be optimized?
    - What are the cost implications of using Pinecone and OpenAI embeddings at scale?

## 4. Database Management (Supabase/PostgreSQL & Prisma)
    - What are the definitive steps and configurations to resolve the `P1001: Can't reach database server` error when using Prisma with Supabase (PostgreSQL)? This includes connection string formats, SSL requirements, network configurations (if applicable), and Prisma client generation.
    - What are the best practices for managing database migrations with Prisma in a Supabase environment (e.g., `prisma migrate dev`, `prisma migrate deploy`)?
    - How should connection pooling be configured for Prisma with Supabase to ensure optimal performance and avoid connection exhaustion?
    - What are common issues and solutions related to Prisma's interaction with Supabase's PostgreSQL instance (e.g., roles, permissions, extensions)?
    - How can database backups and recovery be managed effectively with Supabase?
    - Are there specific Prisma client configurations or query patterns that are more performant with Supabase?

## 5. Data Flow & Management
    - What is the recommended data flow for a new chat message: from user input in Next.js frontend, to Next.js backend, to Supabase for persistent storage, to OpenAI for embedding, and then to Pinecone for indexing?
    - How should data consistency be maintained between Supabase (primary data store) and Pinecone (search index)? What are strategies for handling updates or deletions?
    - What are the security best practices for handling API keys and sensitive data (`DATABASE_URL`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) within a Next.js application, particularly concerning `[.env.local](.env.local)` and environment variable management in Vercel/deployment?
    - How should user-specific data be isolated and secured across these services?

## 6. Acceptance Testing Informants
    - What are typical end-to-end user flows for a chat application with authentication and semantic search? (e.g., User signs up -> logs in -> starts a new chat -> sends messages -> AI responds -> user searches past conversations -> views search results).
    - What are the key success criteria for each part of these flows? (e.g., successful login redirects to chat, search results are relevant and timely).
    - How can the "enhanced" aspects of the chat (beyond basic messaging) be verified through acceptance tests?
    - What edge cases or error conditions should be considered for acceptance tests (e.g., failed login, empty search results, API errors from Supabase/Pinecone/OpenAI)?

## 7. Master Project Plan Informants
    - What are the logical, sequential tasks required to implement user authentication with Supabase?
    - What are the distinct tasks for setting up Pinecone, creating an index, implementing embedding generation, and building the search query logic?
    - What specific tasks are needed to resolve database connectivity issues and establish a robust Prisma-Supabase setup?
    - How can the overall project be broken down into smaller, AI-verifiable milestones?
    - What are the dependencies between these high-level tasks?

## 8. Architectural Patterns
    - Given the tech stack, what are common and recommended architectural patterns for structuring the Next.js application (frontend and backend/API routes)?
    - How should services like Supabase, Pinecone, and OpenAI clients be initialized and managed within the Next.js application lifecycle?
    - What are considerations for state management in the Next.js frontend, especially concerning user authentication status and chat data?
    - If `[docs/data_storage_architecture.md](docs/data_storage_architecture.md)` is unavailable, what would be a typical data storage architecture for this system, considering data relationships, access patterns, and the roles of Supabase and Pinecone?
