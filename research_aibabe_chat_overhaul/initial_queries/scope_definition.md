# Research Scope Definition

## Project Goal
Implement Enhanced Chat Functionality with User Authentication and Semantic Search.

## Technology Stack
-   Framework: Next.js, TypeScript
-   Authentication & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL backend)
-   Semantic Search: Pinecone
-   Embedding Service: OpenAI
-   Configuration: `[.env.local](.env.local)`
-   Schema: `[prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma)`
-   Current Vector DB (mocked): `[lib/vector_db.ts](lib/vector_db.ts)`

## Key Research Areas
1.  **Tech Stack Integration:** Best practices, challenges, and strategies for integrating Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Pinecone, and OpenAI embeddings.
2.  **User Authentication:** Robust patterns for Supabase authentication in Next.js, including session management, security considerations, and user experience.
3.  **Semantic Search Implementation:**
    *   Pinecone integration best practices.
    *   Data ingestion strategies for chat messages.
    *   Embedding generation using OpenAI (model `text-embedding-ada-002` or alternatives).
    *   Querying Pinecone from a Next.js backend for relevant chat history.
4.  **Database Management (Supabase/PostgreSQL & Prisma):**
    *   Strategies for reliable setup and connectivity, addressing the `P1001: Can't reach database server` error.
    *   Prisma migration management best practices with Supabase.
    *   Connection pooling and optimization.
5.  **Data Flow & Management:** Key considerations for data movement, consistency, and security between services (Next.js frontend/backend, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI).
6.  **Acceptance Testing Informants:** Information to define high-level, end-to-end acceptance tests for the complete enhanced chat functionality. This includes user registration, login, sending messages, receiving AI responses, and semantic search of chat history.
7.  **Master Project Plan Informants:** Information crucial for creating a detailed Master Project Plan with AI-verifiable tasks. This involves breaking down the implementation into manageable, verifiable steps.
8.  **Architectural Patterns:** Common architectural patterns for applications using this tech stack, especially if `[docs/data_storage_architecture.md](docs/data_storage_architecture.md)` remains unavailable. This includes considerations for scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Out of Scope (Initial Focus)
-   Detailed UI/UX design beyond functional requirements for chat and authentication.
-   Advanced AI persona development beyond the existing `[docs/persona_psychology_principles.md](docs/persona_psychology_principles.md)` and `[prompts/example_refined_persona.md](prompts/example_refined_persona.md)`.
-   Deployment and infrastructure scaling in detail (though high-level considerations might be noted).
-   Billing and subscription management implementation details beyond basic schema presence.

## Contextual Constraints & Considerations
-   The `P1001: Can't reach database server` error needs specific attention regarding Supabase/Prisma connectivity.
-   The unavailability of `[docs/data_storage_architecture.md](docs/data_storage_architecture.md)` means research should cover common patterns.
-   Review of `[docs/persona_psychology_principles.md](docs/persona_psychology_principles.md)` and `[prompts/example_refined_persona.md](prompts/example_refined_persona.md)` for chat interaction context.
-   The existing `[lib/vector_db.ts](lib/vector_db.ts)` provides a baseline for current (mocked) semantic search functionality.
