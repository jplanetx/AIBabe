# Research Scope Definition: AI-Babe Chat System Overhaul

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope of research for the "AI-Babe Chat System Overhaul" project. The primary goal of this research is to gather information that will inform the SPARC Specification phase, specifically the definition of high-level acceptance tests (HLATs) and the Master Project Plan (MPP). The overall user objective is to "Fix the chat. Improve the chat. It is terrible right now repeating itself after just a few back and forths."

## 2. In Scope

The research will cover the following areas, derived from the User Blueprint tasks:

*   **Backend API Resilience (Task 1):**
    *   Best practices for error handling (try/catch) in API requests (fetch/axios) within a Next.js backend.
    *   Strategies for user-friendly fallback UIs in chat applications during API failures.
    *   Implementation of exponential backoff for retrying failed requests (e.g., 503/504 errors), particularly in a Vercel (serverless) environment.
    *   Standardized error response schemas for chat APIs.
*   **Persistent Memory Layer (Task 2):**
    *   Comparison and suitability of PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB for storing user preferences, conversation summaries, and timestamps in a Next.js application.
    *   Optimal schema design for the persistent memory layer.
    *   Efficient techniques for loading and updating memory during user sessions.
    *   Best practices and tools for LLM-based summarization of chat conversations for storage.
*   **Semantic Memory (Vector DB) (Task 3):**
    *   Evaluation of vector database solutions (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for integration with a Next.js application on Vercel, considering cost, scalability, ease of use, and performance.
    *   Comparison of embedding generation models (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace) for chat data.
    *   Strategies for effective chunking of conversation data and application of tags for semantic search.
    *   Efficient querying techniques (e.g., cosine similarity) within the prompt generation pipeline.
    *   Role of semantic memory in advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and maintaining persona consistency.
*   **Persona Drift & Prompt Engineering (Task 4):**
    *   Established techniques for layered system prompts (core persona + dynamic context/memory).
    *   Effective use of RAG pipelines to inject persona-specific facts and maintain character.
    *   Methods to consistently apply persona context ("pinning") each turn without excessive token consumption.
    *   Exploration of methodologies like "PersonaGym" if public information is available.
*   **Chat Frontend Error Handling & UX (Task 5):**
    *   Robust error handling patterns for asynchronous chat handlers in React/Next.js.
    *   Design of non-intrusive error messages and retry options in chat UIs.
    *   Best practices for streaming API responses in Next.js for enhanced chat UX.
    *   Key considerations for mobile responsiveness and accessibility in chat interfaces.

*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns:**
    *   Potential challenges, common pitfalls, and mitigation strategies for each area.
    *   Technology choices relevant to the Next.js and Vercel stack.
    *   Ensuring modularity (modules <500 LOC) and testability.
    *   Integration testing strategies for the interconnected components on Vercel.
    *   Performance implications of each new layer on chat responsiveness.

## 3. Out of Scope

The research will NOT cover:

*   Detailed, low-level implementation code or specific code snippets beyond illustrative examples of patterns.
*   Specific UI/UX design mockups beyond principles for error states and feedback.
*   Marketing strategies, user acquisition, or business model analysis.
*   Deep dives into unrelated audit items (AIB-002, AIB-005, AIB-003, audit 1.2) beyond the problems they highlight in the blueprint; the research will focus on solving the stated problems.
*   Features not explicitly mentioned in the User Blueprint.
