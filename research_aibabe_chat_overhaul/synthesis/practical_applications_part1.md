# Practical Applications & Recommendations - Part 1

This document will outline practical applications of the research findings and provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

## Recommendations based on P1001 Error Research:

1.  **Immediate Action - `DATABASE_URL` Verification:**
    *   Thoroughly verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `[.env.local](.env.local)` and in the Vercel deployment environment.
    *   Ensure it uses the Supabase **pooler connection string** (port `6543`).
    *   Confirm `?sslmode=require` is appended.
    *   Double-check for any special characters in the password that might require URL encoding.

2.  **Prisma Workflow:**
    *   Establish a strict protocol to run `npx prisma generate` after any changes to `[prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma)` or environment variables affecting the database connection.
    *   Integrate `npx prisma migrate deploy` into the deployment pipeline for production environments.

3.  **Environment Variable Strategy:**
    *   Clearly document the required environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and where they should be set for local development versus Vercel deployment.
    *   Emphasize restricting backend-only keys (like `DATABASE_URL` direct components, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) from being exposed to the Next.js client-side bundle. Use Next.js public environment variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) only for values safe for browser exposure (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).

4.  **Consult Official Supabase/Prisma Documentation:**
    *   Bookmark and regularly refer to the Supabase guide on using Prisma: [https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/prisma](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/prisma) and its troubleshooting section.
