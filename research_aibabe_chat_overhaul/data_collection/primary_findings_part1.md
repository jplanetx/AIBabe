## Query 2: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for backend chat APIs using Node.js Next.js fetch axios

**Date:** 2025-05-23
**Source:** Perplexity AI Search (`perplexity_search_web` MCP tool)
**Recency:** year

**Key Findings:**

### Robust Error Handling

*   **1. Use Custom Error Classes:**
    *   Create custom error classes (e.g., `AppError extends Error`) to categorize errors clearly (validation, network, etc.).
    *   Allows granular handling and better debugging.
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        class AppError extends Error {
          constructor(message, statusCode) {
            super(message);
            this.statusCode = statusCode;
            Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
          }
        }
        ```
    *   Throw these in API logic to distinguish error types.
    *   *Citation:* [2.1], [2.3]

*   **2. Centralized Global Error Handling Middleware:**
    *   In Node.js/Express (relevant for Next.js API routes), implement global error-handling middleware.
    *   Catches all forwarded errors from routes.
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        // Assuming 'app' is your Express instance
        app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
          console.error('Error:', err.message);
          res.status(err.statusCode || 500).json({
            status: 'error',
            message: err.message || 'Internal Server Error',
          });
        });
        ```
    *   Forward route-level errors using `next(error)` for clean and consistent code.
    *   *Citation:* [2.2], [2.4]

*   **3. Handle Uncaught Exceptions & Rejections:**
    *   Add process-level handlers for `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection`.
    *   Logs critical failures and allows for graceful shutdowns if needed.
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {
          console.error('Uncaught Exception:', error);
          // Potentially: process.exit(1);
        });

        process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
          console.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
          // Potentially: process.exit(1);
        });
        ```
    *   Prevents silent crashes.
    *   *Citation:* [2.1]

*   **4. Meaningful Try-Catch Blocks:**
    *   Wrap risky synchronous or asynchronous code (especially `await` calls) with `try-catch`.
    *   Avoid empty `catch` blocks; log or respond appropriately.
    *   Handle specific known errors distinctly when possible.
    *   Example (async/await):
        ```javascript
        try {
           const response = await someAsyncCall();
           // process response
        } catch(error) {
           console.error('Error during someAsyncCall:', error);
           // Handle specific error types, e.g., if (error instanceof NetworkError)
           // next(error); or res.status(500).json(...)
        }
        ```
    *   *Citation:* [2.3]

### Retry Mechanisms for Fetch/Axios Calls

*   **1. Implement Retries with Exponential Backoff:**
    *   Essential for recovering from transient failures (network glitches, temporary server unavailability like 503/504 errors) when calling external chat APIs.
    *   The general pattern involves:
        *   Making an initial attempt.
        *   If it fails (and the error is retryable, e.g., 5xx errors, network errors), wait for a calculated delay.
        *   The delay increases with each retry (exponentially).
        *   Optionally, add jitter (randomness) to the delay to prevent thundering herd problems.
        *   Stop after a maximum number of retries.
    *   Libraries like `axios-retry` can simplify this for Axios. For `fetch`, custom logic is often needed.
    *   Example pattern for Axios (conceptual, as full code was cut off in search result):
        ```javascript
        // const axios = require('axios'); // (already in search result)
        // async function fetchWithRetry(url, options = {}, retries = 3, /* other params like backoffDelay */) { ... }
        // (Search result was incomplete here)
        ```
    *   *Note:* The user blueprint specifically mentions exponential backoff for 503/504 errors.
    *   *Citation:* (Implicit from general best practices, specific library citations would be beneficial for `axios-retry` or similar for `fetch`)

## Query 3: Implementing persistent chatbot memory layer with PostgreSQL or MongoDB schema design conversation summarization

**Date:** 2025-05-23
**Source:** Perplexity AI Search (`perplexity_search_web` MCP tool)
**Recency:** year

**Key Findings:**

### Key Concepts for Persistent Chatbot Memory

*   **Memory Schema:** Defines how conversational data and metadata are stored.
*   **Update Modes:** How new information updates existing memory (e.g., insert new records vs. patch/update existing ones). LangChain's memory template suggests an "insert" mode for new notable memories [3.1].
*   **Summarization:** Condensing conversations into summaries to reduce storage/context window size while preserving essential context. This is crucial for long-term recall.
*   **User/Thread Scoping:** Supporting multiple users or conversation threads by associating memory entries with `user_id` or `thread_id` (or `convo_id`).

### Schema Design Considerations

*   **1. Core Data Elements to Store:**
    *   `user_id` / `thread_id` / `convo_id`: To distinguish between different users or conversation sessions.
    *   `timestamp`: When the message was sent/received.
    *   `message_content`: The actual text of user inputs and bot responses.
    *   `sender_type`: Indicates if the message is from the "user" or "bot".
    *   `contextual_metadata`: Such as message type, intent, entities, sentiment (if available).
    *   `summary_field`: A condensed version of the conversation or specific notable points.

*   **2. Example JSON Schema (Inspired by LangChain Memory Template [3.1]):**
    *   This template focuses on saving "notable memories."
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Note",
          "description": "Save notable memories the user has shared with you for later recall.",
          "update_mode": "insert",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "context": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The situation where this memory is relevant, including any caveats."
              },
              "content": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Specific information, preference, or event being remembered."
              }
            },
            "required": ["context", "content"]
          }
        }
        ```
    *   This structure can be adapted for relational tables (PostgreSQL) or document collections (MongoDB).

### Implementing in PostgreSQL

*   **Suggested Tables** (based on common practice and search result hints):
    *   `users`:
        *   `user_id` (PK, e.g., UUID or SERIAL)
        *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
        *   `preferences` (JSONB, for user-specific settings like persona interaction style, if applicable)
        *   *(Other user-specific fields as needed)*
    *   `conversations` (or `sessions`):
        *   `conversation_id` (PK, e.g., UUID or SERIAL)
        *   `user_id` (FK referencing `users.user_id`)
        *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
        *   `last_updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
        *   `current_summary` (TEXT, stores the latest summary of this conversation)
    *   `messages`:
        *   `message_id` (PK, e.g., UUID or SERIAL)
        *   `conversation_id` (FK referencing `conversations.conversation_id`)
        *   `sender_type` (ENUM('user', 'bot') or VARCHAR)
        *   `content` (TEXT)
        *   `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
        *   `metadata` (JSONB, for intents, entities, etc.)
    *   `conversation_summaries` (if summaries are stored separately or versioned):
        *   `summary_id` (PK)
        *   `conversation_id` (FK)
        *   `summary_text` (TEXT)
        *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
        *   `based_on_message_id` (FK referencing `messages.message_id`, optional, to know up to what point the summary covers)

### Implementing in MongoDB

*   **Suggested Collections:**
    *   `users`:
        ```json
        {
          "_id": " ObjectId() / user_uuid",
          "created_at": "ISODate()",
          "preferences": { "theme": "dark", "persona_style": "witty" }
        }
        ```
    *   `conversations`:
        *   Could embed messages directly if conversations are not excessively long, or store messages in a separate collection and reference them.
        *   **Option 1: Embedding Messages (for shorter conversations)**
            ```json
            {
              "_id": "ObjectId() / conversation_uuid",
              "user_id": "user_uuid_ref",
              "created_at": "ISODate()",
              "last_updated_at": "ISODate()",
              "current_summary": "User is planning a trip to Paris...",
              "messages": [
                {
                  "message_id": "message_uuid_1",
                  "sender_type": "user",
                  "content": "Hi there!",
                  "timestamp": "ISODate()",
                  "metadata": { "intent": "greeting" }
                },
                {
                  "message_id": "message_uuid_2",
                  "sender_type": "bot",
                  "content": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
                  "timestamp": "ISODate()",
                  "metadata": {}
                }
                // ... more messages
              ]
            }
            ```
        *   **Option 2: Separate `messages` Collection (for longer conversations, better scalability)**
            *   `conversations` collection:
                ```json
                {
                  "_id": "ObjectId() / conversation_uuid",
                  "user_id": "user_uuid_ref",
                  "created_at": "ISODate()",
                  "last_updated_at": "ISODate()",
                  "current_summary": "User is planning a trip to Paris..."
                }
                ```
            *   `messages` collection:
                ```json
                {
                  "_id": "ObjectId() / message_uuid",
                  "conversation_id": "conversation_uuid_ref",
                  "sender_type": "user",
                  "content": "Tell me about the Eiffel Tower.",
                  "timestamp": "ISODate()",
                  "metadata": { "entities": ["Eiffel Tower"] }
                }
                ```

### Conversation Summarization Strategies

*   **Periodic Summarization:** Use an LLM to summarize the conversation after a certain number of turns or when a conversation ends. Store this summary in the `conversations` table/collection.
*   **Rolling Summaries:** Maintain a summary that is updated incrementally. After each new message or a few messages, the existing summary and new messages are fed to an LLM to produce an updated summary.
*   **Buffer Window + Summary:** Keep a buffer of the most recent N messages in full detail, plus a summary of everything before that. This is a common LangChain pattern (e.g., `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`) [3.5].
*   **Key Information Extraction:** Instead of or in addition to free-form summaries, extract key entities, facts, or user preferences mentioned and store them in a structured way (e.g., in the `users.preferences` JSONB field or a dedicated `user_facts` table/collection). The LangChain memory template [3.1] leans towards this by saving "notable memories" with context and content.
*   **Tools for Summarization:** LangChain provides various memory modules that can handle summarization, such as `ConversationSummaryMemory` and `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` [3.5]. These can be integrated with LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).
*   Platforms like Mem0.ai aim to provide intelligent, self-improving memory by abstracting some of these complexities [3.2].
