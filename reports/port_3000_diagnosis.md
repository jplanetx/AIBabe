# Diagnosis Report: TCP Port 3000 Usage

## 1. Issue Overview

The application failed to start with an `EADDRINUSE` error on port 3000, indicating that the port was already in use by another process on the system. This report details the findings of the investigation to identify the process occupying TCP port 3000.

## 2. Investigation Steps and Findings

To identify the process using TCP port 3000, the following commands were executed:

1.  **`netstat -ano -p tcp | findstr ":3000"`**
    *   **Purpose:** To list all active TCP connections and listening ports, then filter for entries related to port 3000. The `-a` flag displays all connections and listening ports, `-n` displays addresses and port numbers numerically, `-o` displays the owning process ID associated with each connection, and `-p tcp` restricts the output to TCP protocol. The output was then piped to `findstr` to filter for lines containing ":3000".
    *   **Output (as observed):**
        ```
        TCP    0.0.0.0:3000           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       16440
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This output indicates that a process with PID `16440` is listening on TCP port 3000 on all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

2.  **`tasklist /fi "PID eq 16440"`**
    *   **Purpose:** To identify the executable name associated with the PID `16440` found in the previous step. The `/fi` flag is used to apply a filter, and `"PID eq 16440"` specifies that we are looking for the process with that specific PID.
    *   **Output (as observed):**
        ```
        Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
        ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
        node.exe                     16440 Console                    1    122,560 K
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This output confirms that the process with PID `16440` is `node.exe`.

## 3. Conclusion

The investigation successfully identified the process using TCP port 3000:

*   **Process ID (PID):** `16440`
*   **Executable Name:** `node.exe`

One process was found to be using TCP port 3000. The PID and process name were clearly identified.

## 4. Suggested Actions

To resolve the `EADDRINUSE` error and allow the application to start on port 3000, one of the following actions can be taken:

1.  **Terminate the existing `node.exe` process (PID 16440):**
    *   This can be done using Task Manager (Details tab, find PID 16440 or `node.exe`, then End Task).
    *   Alternatively, use the command line: `taskkill /PID 16440 /F` (The `/F` flag forcefully terminates the process).
    *   **Caution:** Ensure that this `node.exe` process is not critical for other ongoing work before terminating it.

2.  **Configure the application to use a different port:**
    *   If the existing `node.exe` process is required, modify the application's configuration to listen on an alternative, unused port (e.g., 3001, 3002, etc.).

## 5. Self-Reflection

*   **Accuracy of Commands:** The commands `netstat -ano -p tcp | findstr ":3000"` and `tasklist /fi "PID eq 16440"` are standard and accurate Windows commands for identifying processes using specific ports and their associated executable names.
*   **Number of Processes Found:** One process (PID 16440) was found using port 3000.
*   **Clarity of Reported PID and Process Name:** The PID (`16440`) and process name (`node.exe`) were clearly identified and reported.
