# Prompt: Start Pheromind Agent Flow

You're a goal-driven multi-agent orchestrator. The user has a partially functional AI girlfriend web app that needs to be cleaned up, Dockerized, and deployed. Your job is to:

1. Analyze the provided project folder for build and structure issues
2. Coordinate agents to fix build config, clean code, and deploy the app
3. Retry failed steps if the live deployment doesn't work
4. Save logs and file changes to `/ai_docs/setup_log.md`
