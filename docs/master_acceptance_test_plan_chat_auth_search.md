# Master Acceptance Test Plan: Enhanced Chat Functionality

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Master Acceptance Test Plan (MATP) for the "Enhanced Chat Functionality with User Authentication and Semantic Search" project. The project aims to integrate robust user authentication using Supabase, and advanced semantic search capabilities using Pinecone and OpenAI, into a Next.js and TypeScript application.

This MATP defines the overall strategy for acceptance testing, ensuring that the final product meets the specified requirements and user expectations. These tests are designed to be broad, user-centric, and verify complete system flows and integration from an external perspective, embodying the Specification phase of the SPARC framework.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### 2.1. In Scope
The following features and functionalities are in scope for acceptance testing:
*   **User Authentication (Supabase):**
    *   User registration (new account creation).
    *   User login and logout.
    *   Session management and persistence.
    *   Route protection for authenticated features.
    *   User profile data interaction (basic).
*   **Chat Functionality:**
    *   Access to chat interface for authenticated users.
    *   Sending messages.
    *   Receiving messages/responses.
*   **Semantic Search Integration (Pinecone & OpenAI):**
    *   Embedding of user queries via OpenAI.
    *   Upserting and querying vectors in Pinecone.
    *   Delivery of semantically relevant responses within the chat interface.
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   Clear feedback for authentication failures (e.g., incorrect credentials, account already exists).
    *   Feedback for semantic search issues (e.g., inability to process query, no relevant results).
    *   Graceful handling of backend service unavailability (e.g., Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI).
*   **Database Interaction:**
    *   Implicit verification of database connectivity and health through successful execution of core features (user creation, message storage/retrieval if applicable to chat flow).

### 2.2. Out of Scope
The following are out of scope for *this specific set* of high-level acceptance tests, though they may be covered by other testing levels (unit, integration, performance):
*   Detailed performance, load, and stress testing.
*   Usability testing beyond basic flow completion.
*   Specific UI/UX design element verification (unless it breaks functionality).
*   Security vulnerability penetration testing (beyond basic auth checks).
*   Administration interfaces (if any).
*   Specific debugging of known issues like P1001, unless they block core acceptance criteria. (Successful test completion implies P1001 is resolved for the tested flows).
*   Migration of existing user data (if any).

## 3. Objectives

*   Verify that all core functionalities outlined in the project goal and user blueprint are implemented correctly.
*   Ensure seamless integration between Next.js frontend, Supabase (auth & DB), Pinecone (vector DB), and OpenAI (embeddings).
*   Confirm that the system provides a positive user experience for the defined user flows.
*   Validate that error conditions are handled gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback.
*   Establish that the system meets the ultimate success criteria defined for the project.
*   Provide a basis for stakeholder sign-off on project completion.

## 4. Test Strategy

### 4.1. Test Levels & Types
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Acceptance Testing:**
    *   Focus: Simulating real user scenarios from start to finish, covering complete user flows.
    *   Method: Primarily black-box testing, interacting with the UI and APIs as a user would.
    *   Examples: User registers, logs in, sends a chat message, receives a semantic response, logs out.
*   **API Integration Testing (as part of E2E validation):**
    *   Focus: Verifying interactions between the Next.js application and backend services (Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI APIs).
    *   Method: Observing API calls (e.g., via browser developer tools or test hooks if available) and their responses during E2E tests to confirm correct data exchange and status codes. AI verification will rely on observable outcomes.

### 4.2. Approach
*   **User-Centric:** Tests will be designed based on user stories and expected user interactions.
*   **AI Verifiable:** Each test case will have clearly defined, programmatically verifiable success criteria. This includes checking UI states, API responses (implicitly through UI or explicit checks if feasible at this level), and data persistence/retrieval.
*   **Implementation Agnostic (Largely):** Tests will focus on *what* the system does, not *how* it does it, allowing for flexibility in implementation details as long as the observable outcomes are met.
*   **Iterative:** Acceptance tests may be refined as development progresses and more clarity is gained on specific implementations, but the core high-level objectives will remain.

## 5. Test Environment

*   **Target Environment:** A staging or pre-production environment that closely mirrors the production setup.
*   **Required Services:**
    *   Deployed Next.js application.
    *   Accessible Supabase instance (with correct `DATABASE_URL` including pooler, port `6543`, `sslmode=require`).
    *   Accessible Pinecone instance.
    *   Accessible OpenAI API (for embeddings).
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Environment variables (`.env.local` or equivalent in the test environment) must be correctly configured for Supabase, Pinecone, and OpenAI.
    *   `prisma generate` must have been run successfully against the target database schema.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   Test user accounts will be created as part of the testing process.
    *   Sample data for semantic search (if pre-population is required for meaningful tests) should be available or loadable.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing features to pass acceptance tests, fixing defects.
*   **QA/Testing Team (or designated personnel/AI):** Responsible for designing, executing, and maintaining acceptance tests, reporting results.
*   **Product Owner/Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing and approving acceptance test plan and results, providing final sign-off.
*   **AI (Test Execution & Verification):** Responsible for programmatically executing tests and verifying outcomes against defined criteria.

## 7. Success Criteria for the Project

The project will be considered successful when:
*   All high-level end-to-end acceptance tests defined in `docs/high_level_acceptance_tests_chat_auth_search.md` pass consistently in the target test environment.
*   Core user authentication flows (registration, login, logout, protected routes) are functional and secure.
*   Authenticated users can engage in chat conversations.
*   Chat responses demonstrate semantic understanding through successful integration with Pinecone and OpenAI.
*   The system handles common error scenarios gracefully, providing clear user feedback.
*   The P1001 database connectivity error is resolved, as evidenced by the successful operation of database-dependent features.

## 8. Deliverables

*   This Master Acceptance Test Plan document (`docs/master_acceptance_test_plan_chat_auth_search.md`).
*   High-Level End-to-End Acceptance Tests document (`docs/high_level_acceptance_tests_chat_auth_search.md`).
*   Test Execution Reports (generated by AI or manual testers).
*   Defect Reports (as needed).
*   Final Acceptance Test Summary Report.

## 9. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   The necessary test environments and third-party services (Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI) will be available and correctly configured.
*   The application will be deployed to the test environment in a stable state for each testing cycle.
*   Any required test data will be available or can be created.
*   The `prisma/schema.prisma` is stable and migrated to the Supabase instance.
*   The research findings regarding Supabase Auth (using `@supabase/ssr`, middleware) and Pinecone/OpenAI integration (LangChain, embeddings) are accurate and form the basis of the implementation being tested.
