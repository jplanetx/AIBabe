# High-Level End-to-End Acceptance Tests: Enhanced Chat Functionality

This document outlines the high-level, user-centric, end-to-end acceptance tests for the "Enhanced Chat Functionality with User Authentication and Semantic Search" project. These tests are designed to be broad, verify complete system flows and integration, and embody the ultimate success criteria. Each test includes AI verifiable completion criteria.

## Test Format Legend:
*   **Scenario:** A brief description of the user goal.
*   **Given:** The pre-conditions for the test.
*   **When:** The actions performed by the user or system.
*   **Then:** The expected outcomes.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:** Specific, programmatically checkable conditions for test success. This might involve checking for UI elements, text content, API call success (implicitly through UI changes or explicitly if observable), or database state changes (verified through subsequent actions).

## 1. User Authentication and Account Management (Supabase)

### Test Case 1.1: Successful User Registration
*   **Scenario:** A new user registers for an account.
*   **Given:** The user is on the registration page and does not have an existing account.
*   **When:** The user enters a unique email, a strong password, confirms the password, and submits the registration form.
*   **Then:** The user is successfully registered, a new user record is created in Supabase, and they are redirected to the login page or a "please verify your email" page, or directly into the application if auto-login is enabled post-registration.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: A success message is displayed (e.g., "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify." or "Welcome!").
    *   UI: User is redirected to the expected page (login, email verification, or app dashboard).
    *   System State (indirect): A subsequent login attempt with the new credentials (Test Case 1.2) should be successful after email verification if required.
    *   System State (direct, if observable via admin/test API): A new user entry exists in the Supabase `auth.users` table (and potentially a `profiles` table) with the provided email.

### Test Case 1.2: Successful User Login
*   **Scenario:** An existing registered user logs into the application.
*   **Given:** The user has a registered and verified account and is on the login page.
*   **When:** The user enters their correct email and password and submits the login form.
*   **Then:** The user is successfully authenticated, a session is established, and they are redirected to the main chat interface or dashboard.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: User is redirected to the authenticated area of the application (e.g., `/chat` or `/dashboard`).
    *   UI: Personalized elements are visible (e.g., username display, logout button).
    *   System State: A valid session cookie (e.g., `sb-access-token`) is set in the browser.
    *   System State (indirect): User can access features requiring authentication (Test Case 2.1).

### Test Case 1.3: Failed Login - Incorrect Credentials
*   **Scenario:** A user attempts to log in with incorrect credentials.
*   **Given:** The user is on the login page.
*   **When:** The user enters a valid email format but an incorrect password (or an unregistered email) and submits the login form.
*   **Then:** The login attempt fails, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user on the login page. The user remains on the login page.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: An error message is displayed (e.g., "Invalid login credentials" or "User not found").
    *   UI: The user remains on the login page (or is not redirected to an authenticated area).
    *   System State: No session cookie is set or an existing one is invalidated.

### Test Case 1.4: User Logout
*   **Scenario:** An authenticated user logs out of the application.
*   **Given:** The user is logged into the application.
*   **When:** The user clicks the logout button/link.
*   **Then:** The user's session is terminated, and they are redirected to the login page or homepage.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: User is redirected to a non-authenticated page (e.g., `/login` or `/`).
    *   UI: Personalized elements (e.g., username, logout button) are no longer visible.
    *   System State: The session cookie is cleared or invalidated.
    *   System State (indirect): Attempting to access authenticated routes (Test Case 2.2) should fail or redirect to login.

### Test Case 1.5: Registration with Existing Email
*   **Scenario:** A user attempts to register with an email address that already exists.
*   **Given:** The user is on the registration page, and the email they intend to use is already associated with an existing account.
*   **When:** The user enters an existing email, a password, confirms the password, and submits the registration form.
*   **Then:** The registration fails, and an appropriate error message is displayed (e.g., "User with this email already exists."). The user remains on the registration page.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: An error message indicating the email is already in use is displayed.
    *   UI: User remains on the registration page.
    *   System State (direct, if observable): No new user record is created in Supabase for this attempt.

## 2. Authenticated Access to Chat Features

### Test Case 2.1: Accessing Chat Interface when Authenticated
*   **Scenario:** A logged-in user navigates to or is presented with the chat interface.
*   **Given:** The user is successfully logged in (as per Test Case 1.2).
*   **When:** The user navigates to the chat page (e.g., `/chat`).
*   **Then:** The chat interface loads successfully, displaying elements like the message input area, message display area, and potentially a list of previous conversations.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: The main chat UI elements are visible and enabled (input field, send button, message history area).
    *   UI: No "access denied" or redirection to login occurs.

### Test Case 2.2: Denying Access to Chat Interface when Unauthenticated
*   **Scenario:** An unauthenticated user attempts to access the chat interface directly.
*   **Given:** The user is not logged in (or has logged out as per Test Case 1.4).
*   **When:** The user attempts to navigate directly to an authenticated route (e.g., `/chat` or `/dashboard`) via URL.
*   **Then:** The user is redirected to the login page, and an appropriate message might be displayed (e.g., "You need to log in to access this page.").
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: The user is on the login page (`/login`).
    *   UI: The chat interface is not displayed.
    *   UI (optional): A message indicating the need for login is shown.

## 3. Core Chat Functionality and Semantic Search

### Test Case 3.1: Sending a Message and Receiving a Semantically Relevant Response
*   **Scenario:** An authenticated user sends a message and receives a response that demonstrates semantic understanding.
*   **Given:** The user is logged in and on the chat interface. Pinecone and OpenAI services are operational and configured. Relevant data (if any pre-loaded) exists in Pinecone.
*   **When:** The user types a meaningful question or statement (e.g., "Tell me about sustainable energy sources") into the chat input and submits it.
*   **Then:**
    1.  The user's message appears in the chat history.
    2.  The system processes the message (embeds it using OpenAI, queries Pinecone).
    3.  A response is received from the system and displayed in the chat history.
    4.  The response is semantically relevant to the user's input.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: The user's sent message is visible in the chat display area.
    *   UI: A response message from the system appears in the chat display area within a reasonable time (e.g., <10 seconds for this high-level test).
    *   Content (AI NLP check): The system's response content is contextually appropriate and related to the user's query. (This requires an AI model to evaluate semantic relevance. For simpler AI verification, keywords or expected themes in the response can be checked if the test data/domain is constrained).
    *   System State (indirect): Network requests to OpenAI (for embedding) and Pinecone (for query) are made successfully (observable via browser dev tools during manual confirmation, or mock/spy verification in automated test environments if instrumented). The P1001 error should not occur.

### Test Case 3.2: Sending Multiple Messages in a Session
*   **Scenario:** An authenticated user sends multiple messages in a single chat session.
*   **Given:** The user is logged in, on the chat interface, and has already sent at least one message.
*   **When:** The user sends a subsequent message.
*   **Then:** The new message and its corresponding response are appended to the chat history correctly, maintaining the conversation flow.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: Both the new user message and the new system response appear in the chat display area below previous messages.
    *   UI: The chat interface remains responsive.
    *   Content (AI NLP check): The new response is relevant to the new message, potentially considering conversation context.

### Test Case 3.3: Semantic Search Failure - No Relevant Results
*   **Scenario:** User query results in no relevant information from Pinecone.
*   **Given:** The user is logged in and on the chat interface. Pinecone and OpenAI services are operational.
*   **When:** The user types a query that is unlikely to have relevant matches in the Pinecone index (e.g., a completely obscure or nonsensical query).
*   **Then:** The system displays a user-friendly message indicating that no relevant information was found or that it cannot answer the query.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: The user's sent message is visible.
    *   UI: A system response is displayed indicating no results or inability to answer (e.g., "Sorry, I couldn't find any information on that," or "I'm not sure how to respond to that.").
    *   UI: The response is not a generic error message or stack trace.

## 4. Basic Error Handling and User Feedback

### Test Case 4.1: Handling Temporary Backend Service Unavailability (e.g., Pinecone Down)
*   **Scenario:** A backend service required for semantic search (e.g., Pinecone or OpenAI) is temporarily unavailable.
*   **Given:** The user is logged in and on the chat interface. One of the critical backend services is simulated to be down or unresponsive.
*   **When:** The user sends a message requiring semantic search.
*   **Then:** The system displays a graceful error message to the user (e.g., "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to my knowledge base right now. Please try again later.") instead of crashing or showing a technical error.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: The user's sent message is visible.
    *   UI: A user-friendly error message is displayed indicating a temporary issue.
    *   UI: The application remains stable and usable for other functions if applicable (e.g., user can still type, but search fails gracefully).
    *   System State (indirect): No unhandled exceptions are thrown to the frontend causing a crash.

### Test Case 4.2: Handling Supabase Database Unavailability (Implicit P1001 Check)
*   **Scenario:** The Supabase database is unreachable during an operation that requires it (e.g., login, registration, or chat message persistence if implemented).
*   **Given:** The Supabase database is simulated to be unreachable (e.g., incorrect `DATABASE_URL` or network issue).
*   **When:** The user attempts an action requiring database interaction (e.g., login).
*   **Then:** The system displays a graceful error message (e.g., "Unable to connect to the service. Please try again later.") rather than a raw P1001 error or crashing.
*   **AI Verifiable Criteria:**
    *   UI: A user-friendly error message is displayed indicating a service connection issue.
    *   UI: The application does not crash or expose technical error details like "P1001" directly to the user in an unformatted way.
    *   System State (indirect): The specific operation (e.g., login) fails, but the application remains stable.
