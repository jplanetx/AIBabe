# Technical Update Summary: Reset Password Confirm Page

**Component:** [`app/auth/reset-password/confirm/page.tsx`](app/auth/reset-password/confirm/page.tsx)
**Related Security Report:** [`reports/security_review_reset_password_confirm_page_post_v1_fix_20250527.md`](reports/security_review_reset_password_confirm_page_post_v1_fix_20250527.md)

This document summarizes recent technical changes made to the Reset Password Confirmation page component. These updates primarily address the 'V1: Sensitive Token Exposure in URL' vulnerability and also include fixes for build errors related to `useSearchParams`.

## Key Changes:

1.  **Security Enhancements: Mitigation of V1 Token Exposure**
    *   **URL Token Ingestion and Cleaning:**
        *   On component mount, `access_token` and `refresh_token` are read from the URL query parameters.
        *   These tokens are immediately stored in the component's local state (e.g., `initialAccessToken`, `initialRefreshToken`).
        *   Crucially, the URL is then "cleaned" using `window.history.replaceState(null, '', window.location.pathname)`. This action removes the token parameters from the browser's visible URL and the current entry in the session history.
        *   **Purpose:** This mechanism significantly reduces the window of opportunity for client-side token exposure through vectors like shoulder surfing, casual browser history inspection, or `Referer` header leakage if the user navigates away *after* the URL is cleaned.
    *   **State-Held Tokens for API Calls:**
        *   Subsequent API calls to `/api/auth/update-password` utilize the tokens stored in the component's state, not directly from the (now cleaned) URL.
    *   **User Guidance:**
        *   A message ("Remember: Password reset links are sensitive. Do not share them.") has been added to the UI to advise users on handling sensitive links.
    *   **Context:** These changes are client-side mitigations for the 'V1: Sensitive Token Exposure in URL' vulnerability. While they reduce client-side exposure, the full remediation of V1 also depends on robust backend token handling practices (e.g., single-use, short-lived tokens), as detailed in the referenced security report ([`reports/security_review_reset_password_confirm_page_post_v1_fix_20250527.md`](reports/security_review_reset_password_confirm_page_post_v1_fix_20250527.md)).

2.  **`<React.Suspense>` Boundary Implementation:**
    *   The `ResetPasswordConfirmForm` component, which utilizes the `useSearchParams` hook (for initially reading tokens before they are moved to state and the URL is cleaned), is wrapped with a `<React.Suspense>` boundary in the default export `ResetPasswordConfirmPage`.
    *   This addresses potential build errors and ensures correct rendering.
    *   A fallback UI (`<div><p>Loading page...</p></div>`) is provided.

3.  **Updated Token Handling Logic for Password Update:**
    *   The component initially retrieves `access_token` and `refresh_token` from the URL's search parameters.
    *   After storing them in state and cleaning the URL, these state-held tokens are included in the JSON body of the `POST` request to the `/api/auth/update-password` endpoint.

## Reason for Changes:

*   **Security (V1 Mitigation):** The primary security driver was to mitigate the 'V1: Sensitive Token Exposure in URL' vulnerability by reducing the time tokens are present in the URL and browser history on the client-side.
*   **Build Error Resolution:** To resolve a build error associated with `useSearchParams` when used directly in a page component. Wrapping the hook's usage within a component then dynamically loaded via `<Suspense>` is a common mitigation pattern.
*   **Functional Correctness:** Ensuring tokens are correctly captured and used for the password update API call, while enhancing security.

This update enhances the security, robustness, and reliability of the password reset confirmation page.
