# Framework Scaffold Report: Prisma Environment Preparation for Clean Migrations

Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## 1. Objective

This report summarizes the framework scaffolding activities undertaken to prepare the Prisma environment for clean database migrations, specifically addressing persistent migration failures before attempting Task 4.3.SM (Implement Database Migrations for Semantic Memory). The actions correspond to Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the 'New Plan to Resolve Issues' from the UBER orchestrator's directive.

## 2. Activities Performed & Outcomes

The following steps were executed by delegating tasks to specialized AI worker agents:

### Step 1: Baseline Existing Supabase Schema via Introspection

*   **1.1: Ensure `.env` contains correct `DATABASE_URL` for Supabase (Direct Connection with Service Role Key)**
    *   **Action:** A `devops-foundations-setup` agent was tasked to modify the `DATABASE_URL` in the [`.env`](./.env) file.
    *   **Outcome:** Successful. The `DATABASE_URL` was updated to `postgresql://postgres:YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_PLACEHOLDER@db.vpvfrqslgigcledfdiww.supabase.co:5432/postgres?schema=public` (where `YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_PLACEHOLDER` represents the actual placeholder value of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from [`.env`](./.env:27)). This ensures Prisma uses a direct connection with full permissions for introspection.
    *   **File Modified:** [`.env`](./.env)

*   **1.2: Execute `npx prisma db pull`**
    *   **Action:** A `devops-foundations-setup` agent was tasked to execute `npx prisma db pull`.
    *   **Outcome:** Successful. The command completed, introspecting 12 models from the Supabase database and updating the local [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file. Warnings regarding copied relations due to lack of foreign keys were noted as standard Prisma behavior in this context.
    *   **File Modified:** [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma)

*   **1.3: Modify [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) to remove Supabase `auth` schema models**
    *   **Action:** A `coder-framework-boilerplate` agent was tasked to inspect and remove any Supabase internal `auth` schema models from [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma).
    *   **Outcome:** Successful. The agent reviewed the schema and determined that no models belonging to the Supabase internal `auth` schema were present after the `db pull`. The existing `User` model was confirmed as application-specific. No models were removed.
    *   **File Modified:** None (as no `auth` models were found to remove).

### Step 2: Split Out Supabase Auth Schema

*   **Action:** This step was effectively covered by the actions in Step 1.3.
*   **Outcome:** Confirmed that [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) only contains application-specific tables and not Supabase's internal `auth` tables.

### Step 3: Create a Local “Shadow” Database for Migrations

*   **3.1: Ensure a local PostgreSQL instance is running (Docker)**
    *   **Action:** A `devops-foundations-setup` agent was tasked to start a PostgreSQL Docker container.
    *   **Outcome:** Successful. After resolving initial port and name conflicts, the Docker container `shadow-pg` (using `postgres:15` image) was started successfully, exposing port `5432` in the container to host port `5434`. Credentials: `postgres`/`shadow_pass`.
    *   **Commands Executed:**
        *   `docker run --name shadow-pg -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=shadow_pass -p 5434:5432 -d postgres:15`
        *   `docker ps -f name=shadow-pg` (for verification)

*   **3.2: Add/Update `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` in [`.env`](./.env)**
    *   **Action:** A `devops-foundations-setup` agent was tasked to update the `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` in the [`.env`](./.env) file.
    *   **Outcome:** Successful. The `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` in [`.env`](./.env) was updated to `postgresql://postgres:shadow_pass@localhost:5434/postgres?schema=public`, reflecting the running Docker container's port and credentials.
    *   **File Modified:** [`.env`](./.env)

*   **3.3: Modify [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) to include `shadowDatabaseUrl`**
    *   **Action:** A `coder-framework-boilerplate` agent was tasked to add/update `shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")` in the `datasource db` block of [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma).
    *   **Outcome:** Successful. The agent confirmed that the `shadowDatabaseUrl` property was already correctly configured in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma:11). No changes were needed.
    *   **File Modified:** None (as the configuration was already correct).

## 3. Summary of AI Verifiable End Results Achieved

*   The command `npx prisma db pull` executed successfully.
*   The [`.env`](./.env) file has been updated with `DATABASE_URL` (formatted for direct connection with service role key placeholder) and `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` (pointing to the local Docker shadow DB on port `5434`).
*   [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) reflects the introspected schema from Supabase.
*   It was confirmed that no Supabase `auth` schema models needed removal from [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) as none were present.
*   [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) includes `shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")` in its `datasource db` block (this was pre-existing and verified).
*   A local PostgreSQL Docker container (`shadow-pg`) is confirmed to be running and accessible on host port `5434`.

## 4. Conclusion

The Prisma environment has been successfully prepared according to the specified plan. The database schema has been introspected, connection URLs for both the main Supabase instance (for introspection) and the local shadow database (for migrations) are configured in [`.env`](./.env), and the Prisma schema file ([`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma)) is set up to use the shadow database. This provides a clean and stable foundation for proceeding with Prisma migrations.
