## Data Flow

### Message Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Reception**: User message received by Smart Chat API
2. **Context Gathering**: 
   - Retrieve conversation history
   - Load user profile
   - Get semantic context from vector database
3. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Detect current emotion and intensity
   - Determine relationship stage and progression
   - Analyze user mood and needs
4. **Prompt Construction**:
   - Build multi-layered smart prompt
   - Integrate persona, emotion, memory, and context
   - Apply relationship-appropriate guidelines
5. **Response Generation**:
   - Generate AI response using enhanced prompt
   - Ensure personality consistency and emotional appropriateness
6. **Learning & Storage**:
   - Update user profile with new insights
   - Ingest message to vector database
   - Auto-summarize if threshold reached
   - Store conversation data
